Sprint #2 Backlog
November 23 to November 30


User Stories from Product Backlog that we will address in this sprint:
J. As a User, I should be able to save the current version of my mock filesystem as a file on the actual file system in the computer
K. As a User, I should be able overwrite current existing version of the mock filesystem on the computer
L. As a User, I should be able to resume progress of my mock filesystem after closing the terminal
M.  As a User, I should be able to load my mock filesystem file from my computer onto J shell


Specific tasks to be accomplished:
1.Add J unit tests for all new classes created 
2. Addition:redirection,  either with>OUTFILE or>>OUTFILE, can be applied to every command
3. Make changes based on feedback from A2A
J-1,K-1 Thoroughly discuss the process of implementing the Save Jshell Command
J-2,K-2 Implement the Save Jshell command
J-3,K-3 Implement error handling
L-1,M-1 Thoroughly discuss the process of implementing the Load Jshell Command
L-2,M-2 Implement the Load Jshell Command
L-3,M-3 Implement error handling
 
These tasks are assigned as follows:


Efkan:
Tasks: 1,2, 3, J-1, K-1, J-2,K-2, J-3, K-3, L-1,M-1, L-2,M-2, L-3, M-3




Artem:        
Tasks:1,2, 3, J-1, K-1, J-2,K-2, J-3, K-3, L-1,M-1, L-2,M-2, L-3, M-3






Justin:        
Tasks: 1,2, 3,J-1, K-1, J-2,K-2, J-3, K-3, L-1,M-1, L-2,M-2, L-3, M-3








Bob: 
Tasks: 1,2, 3,J-1, K-1, J-2,K-2, J-3, K-3, L-1,M-1, L-2,M-2, L-3, M-3






Additional notes(errors, incomplete tasks):
* Were able to complete more command implementations than expected. This includes every needed command expect Save Jshell and Load Jshell commands
* Incomplete tasks:  1.Add J unit tests for all new classes created 
2. Addition:redirection,  either with>OUTFILE or>>OUTFILE, can be applied to every command
