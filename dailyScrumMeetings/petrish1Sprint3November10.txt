What did I work in the last three days?
	- Bug testing our JShell with all appropriate commands
	- Added JavaDoc and changed class/methods to follow proper naming conventions
	- Completed implementation of mkdir and JShell
	- Edge case testing for all commands

What do I plan to work in the next three days?

Am I blocked on anything?
