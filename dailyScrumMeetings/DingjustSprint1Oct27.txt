a) What did I work on in the last three days? 
* We discussed the concept of how to implement directories, and the prototype of a directory object. We decided that the directory object would inherit from a parent class called node. Beginning implementing the node, directoryNode classes.


b) What do I plan to work in the next three days?
        Finish implementing the node and directory Node classes. Finish implementing the mkDir command, including accounting for errors.
