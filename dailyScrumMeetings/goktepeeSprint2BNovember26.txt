What did I work on in the last three days? 
- Added a private string "manual" to each command, which contains information on how the command is used.
- Added an overloaded method 'void printManual()' in each command, which prints the private string manual.
- Several small changes in cat
- Several small changes in mkDir
- Deleted all manual strings from Man, changed how the command works.
- Added a new error message case for pwd
- Changed class names to nouns and verbs

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
- Update ls to A2B standard
