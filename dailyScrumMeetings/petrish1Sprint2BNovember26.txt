What did I work in the last three days?
	- JUnit test cases for all classes and their methods
	- Outlining all edge cases
What do I plan to work in the next three days?
	- Testing of all commands 
	- Check for any remaining bugs in our JShell
	- Change class names to adhere naming convention
	- JUnit completion for all significant methods

Am I blocked on anything?
