a) What did I work on in the last three days? 

We discussed implementation detail with the user 
input class(i.e how user is going to input their desired command). 
Specifically we discussed how we would deal with the multiple ways 
in which an user can input their commands, 
and how the number of white spaces between commands and 
parameters can be ignored, as long as it’s more than one. 
Plan to use the split method in java, to split the input string 
into multiple substrings(spaces will be the delimiters), 
with the first substring representing the command, 
and the rest representing parameters such as file or directory paths. 
These substrings will then be passed onto other classes, so that they complete their purposes.  

b) What do I plan to work in the next three days?
   
Discuss CRC cards, and make any adjustments to existing CRC cards using combined feedback from A1. 
Implement new CRC cards corresponding to the new commands appearing in A2

c) Am I blocked on anything?  
        No
