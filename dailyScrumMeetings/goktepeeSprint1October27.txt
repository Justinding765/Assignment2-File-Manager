What did I work on in the last three days?
-For the last three days, I have worked with everyone to design the implementation behind most of the commands.
-I have collaborated with my teammates to develop the necessary classes to handle user input and run commands.
-I have partially completed the commands 'exit' and 'ls'.

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
-I will complete the 'exit' command
-I will complete the 'ls' command
-I will work on the different input handling conditions for the ls command
-I will create an error handling system for the program

Am I blocked on anything?
-I need to know what is expected from the 'exit' function in order to complete it. i.e. will it only exit the program or is it expected to close the terminal?
-I need to know how the nodes in the directory class will be implemented in order to complete 'ls'.
