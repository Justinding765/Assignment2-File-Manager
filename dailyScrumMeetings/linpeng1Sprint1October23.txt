What did I work on in the last three days?
    - brainstormed design ideas with team for directory implementation
    - Hammered out a plausible concept for user input handling
    - Helped with team on adapting CRC cards

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Finishing CRC cards in a way that fits user story requirements
    - Start implementing the user input handling method
    - After finishing tasks above, I may help finalize a design for
      directory implementation (as that is required for "ls" command)

Am I blocked on anything?
    - N/A
