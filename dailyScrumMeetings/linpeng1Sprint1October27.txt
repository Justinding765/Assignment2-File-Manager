What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Finished planning on on to implement the concept of directories
    - Finished implementing parts of UserInputHandling
    - Further updated CRC cards

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Start working on LS command as instructed in sprint1backlog

Am I blocked on anything?
    - May be delayed on LS if the concept of directories are changed or not finished
    - Based on current pace, no problems will occur
